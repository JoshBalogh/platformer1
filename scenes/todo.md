 (get these done by the end of spring break)

have different classes for the differnet type of slimes ie... bruteSlime, speedSlime, slime, bossSlime

tiled working during 

player sprites done

enemy sprites done
    finished the sprite for reg slime 
        still need to add timer for the attack so it doesn't do it repeditively 

finish the tutorial level(this week)

get half of the first level finished by the end of spring break

when switching the enemy animation to attacking it falls down a couple pixels off lining the animation

add a timer for after the attacking animation sprite so it can reset 




**1
when we write the sprite code we over write it this basically tells the code that "hey we actually need your code" so what it does it puts their code with ours | from  how i understand it. 




bugs

when you enter the first detecting circle the moving animation doesn't start but when you leave that circle the animation starts

tried to add the enemy or player bounce after getting hit just doesn't work






when player gets hit turn off player WASD  and change the velocity | previous problem was when player was getting hit it still had a velocity input... so the CODE didn't know what to do
