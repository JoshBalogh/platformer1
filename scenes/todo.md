boss level finish it




**1
when we write the sprite code we over write it this basically tells the code that "hey we actually need your code" so what it does it puts their code with ours | from  how i understand it. 




bugs[
can hold attack button and do infinite damage | imma keep this unless i have time; just added a timer
try if the button for attack is up reset the timer??? | if you do this make the timer of the spear hitting the enemy longer 


background need to adjust the position
try {
setOrigin
setScale - is to zoom out maybe??
}
]
