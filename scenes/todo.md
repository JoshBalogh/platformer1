IDEAS | 

spear has 2 detections 
    overlap as it stands still(so enemies can go through)
    then if spearAttack=true it turns to collider

figure out how to use TILED to create the maps for game 


add the circle for enemies to be activated OR when on screen it go towards 
-have the enemies go attack when ever they spawn


need to add sprites
-then find out how to make invisible shapes for detection

start on next level of dungeon (need to learn TILED to make map)


FIXES NEED | 
* added the true or false for spear collision it detects it being true but it then doesn't collide
* enemy is immediately hit marking me(idk y)
